Introduction:
Enterprises has 100 or 1000s of applications which has:
- Complex communication patterns
- Varieties of transports : Http,ques
- Variety of protocols Http,JMS,AMQP

Evolution of cloud  and Microservices makes Enterprise integration more complex
How can we simplify  Enterprise integration?==>>>>>>>> (To follow Enterprise integration patterns.)

Apachel camel follows EIP standards.


APACHEL CAMEL:
==> It an Open source integration framework 
+++ It is easly integrates systems consuming or producing data.
+++ It is inspired by a book called "Enterprises integration patterns" by Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf

Advantage:
- It is very Lean (light weght and Extensible).
- You can integrate all these transports and protocols but still light because it uses "Components architecture" this keeps footprint low
- It provide  100+ components  for databases,message ques, APIs, cloud integration
- It also support 200+ protocols, transports and data formats (& 300+ converters)
