Introduction:
Enterprises has 100 or 1000s of applications which has:
- Complex communication patterns
- Varieties of transports : Http,ques
- Variety of protocols Http,JMS,AMQP

Evolution of cloud  and Microservices makes Enterprise integration more complex
How can we simplify  Enterprise integration?==>>>>>>>> (To follow Enterprise integration patterns.)

Apachel camel follows EIP standards.


APACHEL CAMEL:
==> It an Open source integration framework 
+++ It is easly integrates systems consuming or producing data.
+++ It is inspired by a book called "Enterprises integration patterns" by Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf

Advantage:
- It is very Lean (light weght and Extensible).
- You can integrate all these transports and protocols but still light because it uses "Components architecture" this keeps footprint low
- It provide  100+ components  for databases,message ques, APIs, cloud integration
- It also support 200+ protocols, transports and data formats (& 300+ converters)



Practical:
- we use start.spring.io
Group: com.in28minitus.microservices
Artifact: camel-microservices-a
Name : camel-microservices-a
Description : Demo project for camel
Package name : com.in28minitus.microservices.camel-microservices-a

Dependencies:
- Spring Boot DevTools Developer Tools
  Provides fast application restarts, LiveReload, and configurations for enhanced development experience.

- Spring Web Web
  Build web, including RESTful, applications using Spring MVC. Uses Apache Tomcat as the default embedded container.

- Spring Boot Actuator Ops
  Supports built in (or custom) endpoints that let you monitor and manage your application - such as application health, metrics, sessions, etc.

  camel terminlogies:
 camel contex-(0--n)Routes+Components
 - Endpoints - a reference to a q,db or file
 - Route - Is a connection btn endpoints,processor and Transformer(s)
 - Components - Extension ie (Kafka,json,JMS etc)

 Transformation - Data format  transformation - xml to json
                - Data type transformation ie from string to  curencyconversion

Message - is the combination of body,headers and attachments
Exchange - Request and response
      - Exchange Id 
      - Message  Exchange Pattern (MEP) - InOnly amd InOut
      - Input Message  and (Optional) output message
